An SVG is an XML that can contain multiple paths and other shapes and stuff.


1. Create an SVG containing one single path
-------------------------------------------

In Illustrator, create your vector graphics (containing multiple shapes).
Convert everything to paths.
(If you save this as svg and open in an editor, you will get multiple paths)
Select all and go to Object -> Compound Path -> Make.
Save as SVG.

2. Create the C++ JUCE::Path code
---------------------------------

Open the SVG in a text editor and copy the SVG path string - the string after 'd=' - to the SVG Path Converter of the Introjucer.
This provides you with code to paste into a cpp file.
